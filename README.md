# collver

Collver is an open source programming language focused on
ease-of-implementation.

Unlike other programming languages that focus on silly things like memory
safety or ease-of-use, Collver is meant to be as simple to implement as
possible.

The reasons for this are as follows:

1. I'm clueless and have basically no idea how to write a compiler.
2. If I make the implementation simpler, it will be easier to rewrite in itself.

Collver will (hopefully) eventually be written in itself, but for now the
compiler is implemented in python.
